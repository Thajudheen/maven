			<br><p>6.1	The Supplier reserves the right of ownership over the goods delivered up until full payment of all claims arising from \

			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in time. Until ownership has transferred to the Customer, it must promptly write to the Supplier to inform the Supplier if the \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered item becomes the subject of distraint or is otherwise exposed to seizure on the part of third parties. To the extent that \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the third party is not able to reimburse the Supplier for the judicial and extrajudicial costs of a legal action corresponding to \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;§771 ZPO (Code of Civil Procedure), the Customer shall be liable for the loss incurred by the Supplier. \
			<br><p>6.3	The machining and processing or conversion of the delivered item on the part of the Customer shall in all cases be held to have \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been done on behalf of the Supplier. In such a case, the Customer's expectant right to the delivered item shall continue in respect \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the converted item. If the delivered item is processed in conjunction with other items not belonging to the Supplier, then the \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplier shall acquire the right of co-ownership to the new item in proportion to the material value of the supplied item in \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relation to other items being processed at the time of processing. \
			<p><br>6.4The Supplier undertakes to release the collateral accruing to it at the Customer's request, to the extent that its value exceeds the \

		<br><p><font size="2"><b>7. Prohibition of assignment, leasing</b></font> \
			<p><br>7.1	Rights arising from this Agreement may be assigned or transferred to third parties only upon written consent from the Supplier. \
			<p><br>7.2	The Supplier reserves the right to dispute leasing agreements or to decline collaboration with individual lessors without \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statement of reasons. In no case shall the negotiation of leasing agreements represent any grounds for delays in payment. \
			<p><br>7.3	In the event that such payment delays should nevertheless arise, the Contractor must be compensated by both parties to the \
			<<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leasing agreement as joint and several debtors.</br></p> \

			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. free of charge.</br></p> \
		<br><p><font size="2"><b>9. Warranty</b></font> \
			<p><br>9.1	If the Customer should demand subsequent performance because of defects in the supplied item, then the Supplier may at its \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own eliminate the defect or supply a fresh item. For the implementation of all improvements and replacement supplies which \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may seem to the Supplier to be necessary, the Customer must, after consultation with the Supplier, give it adequate time and \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity to proceed; otherwise, the Supplier shall be exempt from the liability for the resultant consequences. Only in urgent \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cases of a potential hazard to operational safety, or in order to prevent disproportionately high damage, in which case the \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplier must be informed immediately, does the Customer have the right to rectify the defect itself or have it rectified by third \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parties and claim compensation from the Supplier for the expenditures incurred. \
			<p><br>9.2	Within the framework of legal provisions, the Customer has the right to withdraw from the Agreement if the Supplier --taking \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account of legal exceptions -- permits a reasonable period of grace which has been allowed for it for rectification or the supply \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a replacement product to elapse without complying. If no more than an insignificant defect arises, then the Customer shall \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only hold the right for reduction of the contractual price. Otherwise, the right for reduction of the contractual price shall remain \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excluded. \
			<p><br>9.3	The warranty shall extend to the replacement of defective material, defective components, assembly services and the \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequently entailed personnel costs (labour time, travelling costs, accommodation and subsistence costs). The warranty \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excludes: downtimes and damage which did not arise on the supplied item itself. This shall not be applicable in the case of \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilful or grossly negligent infringement of the obligations of the Supplier or of its agents, nor in the case of infringement of \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cardinal obligations or if there is a particular criterion of trust involved. Nor shall it be applicable in respect of losses arising \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from loss of life, physical injury or damage to health. \
			<p><br>9.4	The equipment may be operated only by personnel who have been trained by the Supplier. Any infringements shall result in \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exclusion from warranty. In this connection, reference is also made to section 1.6 .1 "Safety" in the Supplier's machine \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;documentation, which is analogously applicable to the warranty.  \
			<br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warranty shall furthermore lapse in the case of: \
			<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Inexpert operation, \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- failure to adhere to the requirements specified by the Supplier for servicing and the servicing intervals, \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- utilisation outside of the scope of the agreed application, and \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- in the case of machining of non-approved materials. \
			<p><br>9.5	The warranty period shall be 12 (twelve) months. For the spindle the warranty period shall be 12 (twelve) months or \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000 operating hours, depending on which is reached first. This reduction does not affect the validity of statutory \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warranty periods arising pursuant to §438, paragraph 1, clause 2 BGB (German Civil Code) and §634 a, paragraph 1, \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clause 2 BGB. The following are also unaffected: statutory warranty periods arising in the event of liability for culpable \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause of fatality, physical injury or damage to health or in the case of liability for the Supplier's wilful or grossly negligent \									<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infringement of obligations or such infringement on the part of its agents. \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warranty period begins on the date of signature of the acceptance report, however no later than 60 days after delivery \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the equipment to the customer.</br></p> \

			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is agreed that software is always developed in accordance with the state-of-the-art available to the Supplier. It is never claimed \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be seamless, such that it is not possible to guarantee unrestricted functionality. Before the Customer's placement of the order, \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it has gained adequate information as to the situation prevailing at the time of order, and is thus held to have declared its \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acceptance of that situation at the time of the order.</br></p> \
		<br><p><font size="2"><b>11. Confidentiality</b></font> \

			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required in order to prevent such information and documentation being exploited by third parties. The employees of the parties \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the contract shall, unless already bound to secrecy under their contracts of employment, be subject to such an obligation to the \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extent that they come into contact with such information or documentation. The same shall apply in respect of the suppliers of \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the parties to the contract. \
			<p><br>11.2	The parties to the contract promise that they themselves will not exploit the information reciprocally disclosed to themselves \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except upon express written approval, and in particular that they will not register any industrial property rights. \
			<p><br>11.3	The obligation for confidentiality and non-exploitation of information reciprocally disclosed shall lapse to the extent that it \

			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) was already known or generally accessible to the public before its disclosure, or \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) was already known or generally accessible to the public after disclosure without collaboration or fault on the part of the \
	   		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;party to the contract receiving the information, or \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) mainly related to information which had at any time been disclosed or made accessible by an authorised third party \
	 		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the party to the contract receiving the information. \
			<p><br>11.4	The confidentiality obligation shall terminate 5 (five) years after the end of the Agreement subject to the provision in \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paragraph in 11.3 above and unless ruled otherwise. \
			<p><br>11.5	The parties to the contract shall, after  termination of the Agreement, promptly destroy any documentation which they have \

			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.3), and shall promptly write to the other party to the contract to report such destruction.</br></p> \
		<br><p><font size="2"><b>12. Service agreement</b></font> \
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expressly recommended that a 2000-hour service contract should be negotiated with the Supplier. The negotiation of a \

			<p><br>13.2	In the event of invalidity of one or of several provisions of this Agreement, the parties to the contract shall negotiate a legally \
