#Executive Summary
quote.exec.soil1                   = The physical characteristics of soil \
                                     influence the choice of crop and variety \
                                     to be grown, as well as irrigation and \
                                     Nutrigation\u0099 planning. In general, \
                                     soil is composed of three components \
                                     \u0096 sand, silt and clay. The relative \
                                     amounts of these components affect the \
                                     soil\u0092s texture and influence its \
                                     water retention rate.<br/>The \
                                     distribution of pores, those areas that \
                                     contain the liquid and gas phases of \
                                     soil, is important. Pores are \
                                     characterized as either small or large. \
                                     Small pores are known as capillary pores. \
                                     In sandy soil, the porosity is permanent \
                                     and stabilized. In heavy soil, the \
                                     porosity changes depending on changes in \
                                     the soil\u0092s moisture. <br/>Water \
                                     retention is affected by soil texture and \
                                     type. For example, 15% moisture volume in \
                                     a light soil will be adequate for crops \
                                     to flourish, while the same percentage in \
                                     a medium soil would be borderline and \
                                     would be insufficient for plant survival \
                                     in heavy soil.
quote.exec.soil2                   = The water is trapped in the pores, and at \
                                     a later stage accumulates as a thin \
                                     liquid around soil particles. When soil \
                                     dries out as a result of percolation, \
                                     evaporation and root intake, the water is \
                                     first extracted from the large pores, \
                                     while still clinging to the small ones. \
                                     When the plant needs water, it draws it \
                                     from the pores, starting with the larger \
                                     ones first. The water retention mechanism \
                                     around soil particles is based on \
                                     retention on the surface area of these \
                                     particles. Sand, silt and clay particles \
                                     build up forming aggregates known as soil \
                                     structure. Well-structured soils have \
                                     more pores and retain more water than \
                                     compact soils. <br/>Silty soils have high \
                                     water retention rates (they consist of \
                                     very small particles, and display a large \
                                     surface area). Light soils have low \
                                     retention rates (they consist of larger \
                                     particles, and display a smaller surface \
                                     area). Soil texture affects irrigation \

                                     available to the \
                                     plant.</li></ul><br/><b>Soil survey</b> \
                                     <br/>In new projects, a soil survey is \
                                     necessary in order to select the most \
                                     suitable soils in the area for the crop \
                                     and to create a uniform block that will \
                                     facilitate operations and reduce the \
                                     investment costs. Soil sampling for the \
                                     survey should be done using an excavator \
                                     to open a soil profile of up to 1.5m in \
                                     depth in order to identify the different \
                                     soil layers of each profile. Once the \
                                     soil layers are identified a sample \
                                     should be taken from each 30cm layer.
