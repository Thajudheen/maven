#Executive Summary
quote.exec.soil1= The physical characteristics of soil influence the choice of crop and variety to be grown, as well as irrigation and Nutrigation™ planning. In general, soil is composed of three components – sand, silt and clay. The relative amounts of these components affect the soil’s texture and influence its water retention rate.<br/>\
The distribution of pores, those areas that contain the liquid and gas phases of soil, is important. Pores are characterized as either small or large. Small pores are known as capillary pores. In sandy soil, the porosity is permanent and stabilized. In heavy soil, the porosity changes depending on changes in the soil’s moisture. <br/>\
Water retention is affected by soil texture and type. For example, 15% moisture volume in a light soil will be adequate for crops to flourish, while the same percentage in a medium soil would be borderline and would be insufficient for plant survival in heavy soil.
quote.exec.soil2=The water is trapped in the pores, and at a later stage accumulates as a thin liquid around soil particles. When soil dries out as a result of percolation, evaporation and root intake, the water is first extracted from the large pores, while still clinging to the small ones. When the plant needs water, it draws it from the pores, starting with the larger ones first. \
The water retention mechanism around soil particles is based on retention on the surface area of these particles. Sand, silt and clay particles build up forming aggregates known as soil structure. Well-structured soils have more pores and retain more water than compact soils. <br/>\
Silty soils have high water retention rates (they consist of very small particles, and display a large surface area). Light soils have low retention rates (they consist of larger particles, and display a smaller surface area). Soil texture affects irrigation scheduling in two important ways:\
<ul> \
	<li>It determines how quickly the soil absorbs water, and it should be known prior to designing an irrigation system.</li> \
	<li>It determines how much water the root zone water reservoir holds, and how much of that water is available to the plant.</li>\
</ul>\<br/>\
<b>Soil survey</b> <br/>\
In new projects, a soil survey is necessary in order to select the most suitable soils in the area for the crop and to create a uniform block that will facilitate operations and reduce the investment costs. Soil sampling for the survey should be done using an excavator to open a soil profile of up to 1.5m in depth in order to identify the different soil layers of each profile. Once the soil layers are identified a sample should be taken from each 30cm layer. 

quote.water.header = Water quality
quote.exec.water = Water quality refers to the variety and concentration of the dissolved and suspended components in the water that influence the possibility of using the water for irrigation (such as poisonous substances and salinity). \
A pressurized irrigation system needs to take into consideration water quality to avoid irrigation component clogging in order to enable proper irrigation based on a program carried out throughout the system’s life. <br/>\
The water’s chemical characteristics are influenced by the variety and concentration of the substances dissolves in it. The dissolved substances include ions of dissolved salts such as chloride and sodium as well as nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium). Calcium and magnesium influence water hardness; iron and manganese are likely to be found either dissolved or as a residue along with other dissolved organic compounds and even poisonous substances. The water quality’s biological characteristics include a variety of living organisms such as microorganisms – including bacteria, viruses, single-celled entities, algae and zooplankton – that develop in open waters, along with creatures developing within the water transport system itself.<br/>\
The biological characteristics of the water quality include a variety of living organisms such as micro-organisms, including bacteria, viruses, single celled entities, algae and zooplankton that develop in open waters along with creatures developing within the water transport system itself. <br/>\
The water quality required for an irrigation system cannot always be defined in terms of particle size or the concentration of any specific factor. The reason is due to the complexity of the clogging factors and the changes occurring to the water as it travels through the irrigation system.<br/>\
The water’s quality must be assessed by analysis, since it will help determine the suitable irrigation system, dripper, Nutrigation plan, and maintenance program<br/>\
Water quality for agriculture is defined according to the following criteria:\
<ul> \
	<li>Agronomic water quality – the extent of its compatibility with the type of soil and crop.</li> \
	<li>Water quality for irrigation – the extent to which it will induce clogging of the irrigation system.</li>\
</ul>\
The water source may be potable water, wastewater, residual water, wells, reservoirs, canals or drainage water. Each one requires different levels of treatment before being used.<br/>\
It is recommended that the irrigation water be analyzed at least once per growing season, and, depending on the meteorological and environmental factors that can influence water quality, during the growing season. <br/>\
Growers maintain minimal control over the water quality, which can vary over time. This means that different treatments are required at different times to ensure that water quality is suitable for the irrigation system.
